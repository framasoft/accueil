  title: Charter
  intro: '@:data.meta.framaname is a network of popular education, originated from

    the education world, which is principally dedicated to free (as in free speech) software.

    It is collaboratively organized around three main issues: promotion, dissemination

    and development of free software, enhancement of open source culture,

    and an online platform of open services.

    - 'The use of free software and open standards on the Internet is
        the main purpose of our project <a href="@:link.dio">@:cat.campagnes.sites.dio.name</a>.'
    - 'Access to source code is the cornerstone of open source principles.
        @:data.meta.name commits itself to place each application available in its projects under
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.fr.html">free license</a>.'
    - 'In case of improvement of the code, @:data.meta.name commits itself to place the contribution
        under free license (compatible with the original license) and will encourage
        any voluntary contribution from users by inviting them to enter
        in contact with the author.'
    - '@:data.meta.name commits itself to make the source code accessible, whether by publishing
        a link pointing to the official website of the application, or, if the latter is no longer
        available, by publishing the code in question on a repository.'
    - 'Doing this, @:data.meta.name demonstrates its probity by allowing every user
        to check the source code, to potentially improve it, and above all to
        ensure that no unfair use will be made of his data, identity, or rights.'
    - 'Users will then be able to knowingly use the available applications
        and learn about all their features, advantages, limits and possible uses.'
    - 'None of the data produced with the help of these applications belong to @:data.meta.name,
        who does not apply any copyright nor censors your content.
        However, any content that would be considered infringing or illegal by French law,
        once duly signaled, will be immediately deleted.'

    - 'By offering open applications online, @:data.meta.name intends to promote
        alternative solutions to proprietary applications that some companies propose in order to
        achieve monopolies and make abusive use of personal data.'
    - 'These alternatives are examples of the diversity of available open-source
        solutions which can be used for personal or collective purpose.
        In this perspective, @:data.meta.name is commited to foster their dissemination
        by publishing tutorials explaining how to install
        these applications on your own server.'
    - 'Equal access to these applications is a strong commitment: by
        offering them for free, @:data.meta.name wishes to promote their use to
        the largest extend, and to give a proof of concept that a decentralized
        and egalitarian Internet is possible.'
  ethic:
    title: For an ethical Internet
    text:
    - 'The ethics of opensource software is about sharing and independence.
        @:data.meta.name commits itself to never practice any censorship of the contents,
        nor any surveillance of the actions of its users, and to never answer
        any administrative or authorities demands without a formal legal request.
        In return, users commit themselves, in production or hosting
        of their contents, to respect the frameworks provided by law.'
    - 'We do not practice any discrimation among users, so as to ensure
        the greatest accessibility.'
    - 'Personal data will not be exploited for commercial issues, or transmitted to
        a third party, nor used for purposes that are not specified in the present charter.
        However, users must be aware that their data might be rendered accessible,
        especially when they make them public in the context of a collaborative application.
        In this case, users remain responsible for their content.'

    - '@:data.meta.name is a non-profit.
        Its volunteers and employees devote their time to ensure the continuity
        of the services offered to users.
        Our business model is based on mutualisation of energies and costs.
        Our services are free, but it does not mean they cost nothing.
        If a large number of supporters financially encouraged @:data.meta.name
        to maintain its services, an even larger number of persons would be able to
        use them, and they could even be improved.'
    - '@:data.meta.name has a popular education approach, and thus shares as much
        knowledge as it can in order to promote the use of free software and
        teach users how to install free services on their servers.
        Sharing technical and cognitive ressources is what makes Internet
        a common good, available for everyone and belonging to no one.'

    - 'From the educational world and now turned towards popular education,

        dates back to 2001.'

    - 'Respect for the fundamental freedoms of users,
        guaranteed by legal contracts (the <a href="@:link.wFreeLicense">free licenses</a>),
        is at the heart of the librist movement and ensures that
        the human remains in control of the digital tool.'
    - 'The @:data.meta.framalink’s goal is to offer, mainly online,
        a set of concrete and practical tools to facilitate adoption:'
    - 'Presented as a "gateway to the Free World",
        the network @:data.meta.framalink wants to position itself as
        a bridge between the librarian community and the general public.'
