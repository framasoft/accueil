    title: 6 good reasons to support us
    list:
    - ['1. Because enclosure is now',
      'NSA, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple… E. Snowden revelations have shown
      that the worst nightmares of computer scientists are alive. We are confined into services,
      tools and a culture centralising our data and using them with no limits. The only way
      out goes through using and educating to free softwares and services, respectful
      of OUR fundamental rights.']
    - ['2. For more free alternatives',
      'For 16 years, @:data.txt.soft has been a french-speaking doorway to free software and culture.
      A link between developers of open solutions and the general public. The success of alternative
      services from "@:txt.dio" shows that it’s possible to respect people
      and their data. We want to go further and only your support will will allow us
      to propose or refine more services.']
    - ['3. Because we are the good guys!',
      '@:data.txt.soft is a group of retired people, employees, unemployed, artists, teachers and students…
      Not really spealized in computer science, but well enough informed to know that Free software is a part
      of the solution. So we commit ourselves to some ethics through a <a href="@:data.link.soft/en/charte">charter</a>
      and we spent our time highlighting or introducing more and more free solutions to a wider audience.']
    - ['4. To choose how you taxes are used',
      'To manage properly the projects, @:data.txt.soft is based upon a non-profit (1901 law in France),
      recognized as of general interest. Your donations can be deducetd from your taxes (in France only).
      For instance, with a recurring donation of €120 (€10 per month for one year), the reduction is €79.20
      and so the actual expense is €40.80. Doing so, you participate directly to our projects,
      productions, structural expenses and the salary of several employees.']
    - ['5. Because the gift economy make us independent',
      'As soon as you click, share, use a software or a website/service, you give it some value.
      This is attention economy. This attention is then financiarized with advertising and the
      sale of data (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, etc.) or with enclosing type of sales
      (Apple, Amazon). This attention can also create some value absed upon donation, sharing
      and participation (Wikipedia). We have chosen this last model for us. This gives us
      independency from the market laws and total freedom to our donators.']
    - ['6. To change the world altogether',
      'Yes, no less. One project after another, we demonstrate that free, simple, respectful
      and community-driven alternatives are possible. In our
      <a href="https://framabook.org">collaborative publishing house</a>, our writers let you
      get freely their digital ebooks and get paid through paper sales or your direct donations.
      Our <a href="@:data.link.dio/en/list">De-google-ify services</a> are more and more used…
      There is still a long road to do and we can go on thanks to your support:
      "There is a long way to go, but the road is Free".']

  title: Charter
  intro: '@:data.color.soft is a network of popular education, which has its origins
    in the education world, which is principally dedicated to free (as in free speech)
    software. It is collaboratively organized around three main issues: promotion,
    dissemination and development of free software, enhancement of open source culture,
    and an online platform of open services.'
  libre:
    title: For an open Internet
    text:
    - The use of free software and open standards on the Internet is the main purpose
      of our project <a href="@:data.link.dio">@:color.dio</a>.
    - Access to source code is the cornerstone of open source principles. @:data.color.soft
      commits itself to place each application available in its projects under <a
      href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.fr.html">free license</a>.
    - In case of improvement of the code, @:data.color.soft commits itself to place
      the contribution under free license (compatible with the original license) and
      will encourage any voluntary contribution from users by inviting them to enter
      in contact with the author.
    - '@:data.color.soft commits itself to make the source code accessible, whether
      by publishing a link pointing to the official website of the application, or,
      if the latter is no longer available, by publishing the code in question on
      a repository.'
    - Doing this, @:data.color.soft demonstrates its probity by allowing every user
      to check the source code, to potentially improve it, and above all to ensure
      that no unfair use will be made of his data, identity, or rights.
    - Users will then be able to knowingly use the available applications and learn
      about all their features, advantages, limits and possible uses.
    - None of the data produced with the help of these applications belong to @:data.color.soft,
      who does not apply any copyright nor censors your content. However, any content
      that would be considered infringing or illegal by French law, once duly signaled,
      will be immediately deleted.
  decentralized:
    title: For a decentralized Internet
    text:
    - By offering open applications online, @:data.color.soft intends to promote alternative
      solutions to proprietary applications that some companies propose in order to
      achieve monopolies and make abusive use of personal data.
    - These alternatives are examples of the diversity of available open-source solutions
      which can be used for personal or collective purpose. In this perspective, @:data.color.soft
      is commited to foster their dissemination by publishing tutorials explaining
      how to install these applications on your own server.
    - 'Equal access to these applications is a strong commitment: by offering them
      for free, @:data.color.soft wishes to promote their use to the largest extent,
      and to give a proof of concept that a decentralized and egalitarian Internet
      is possible.'
  ethic:
    title: For an ethical Internet
    text:
    - The ethics of opensource software is about sharing and independence. @:data.color.soft
      commits itself to never practice any censorship of the contents, nor any surveillance
      of the actions of its users, and to never answer any administrative or authorities
      demands without a formal legal request. In return, users commit themselves,
      in production or hosting of their contents, to respect the frameworks provided
      by law.
    - We do not practice any discrimation among users, so as to ensure the greatest
      accessibility.
    - Personal data will not be exploited for commercial issues, or transmitted to
      a third party, nor used for purposes that are not specified in the present charter.
      However, users must be aware that their data might be rendered accessible, especially
      when they make them public in the context of a collaborative application. In
      this case, users remain responsible for their content.
  solidary:
    title: For an Internet of solidarity
    text:
    - '@:data.color.soft is a non-profit. Its volunteers and employees devote their
      time to ensure the continuity of the services offered to users. Our business
      model is based on mutualisation of energies and costs. Our services are free,
      but it does not mean they cost nothing. If a large number of supporters financially
      encouraged @:data.color.soft to maintain its services, an even larger number
      of persons would be able to use them, and they could even be improved.'
    - '@:data.color.soft has a popular education approach, and thus shares as much
      knowledge as it can in order to promote the use of free software and teach users
      how to install free services on their servers. Sharing technical and cognitive
      ressources is what makes the Internet a common good, available for everyone
      and belonging to no one.'
