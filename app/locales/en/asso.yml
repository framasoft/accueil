  h2: Presentation of @:txt.soft
  p-intro:
  - From the educational world and now turned towards popular education, @:html.soft
    is above all a network of projects, of which the first, <a href="@:link.libre">directory
    @:link.libre</a>, dates back to 2001.
  - 'These projects are run by people working together with the same desire: promote
    digital freedoms.'
  - Respect for the fundamental freedoms of users, guaranteed by legal contracts
    (the <a href="@:link.wFreeLicense">free licenses</a>), is at the heart of the
    librist movement and ensures that the human remains in control of the digital
    tool.
  - 'The @:html.soft’s goal is to offer, mainly online, a set of concrete and
    practical tools to facilitate adoption:'
  ul-axis:
  - of free software (directory, USB sticks, installer…);
  - of free cultural creations (blog, translation, publishing house…);
  - of free services (more than 30 free services in the project <a href="@:link.dio">@:color.dio</a>).
  p-gate:
  - Presented as a "gateway to the Free World", the network @:html.soft wants
    to position itself as a bridge between the librarian community and the general
    public.

  h2: The @:txt.soft association
  p-asso:
  - The network @:html.soft relies on its large community of volunteers but
    could not exist if it wasn’t supported by an association founded in 2004.
  - The @:html.soft association is a 1901 non-profit association whose character
    of general interest authorizes a tax deduction. Which shows its willingness
    to stay an association on a human scale (less than forty members, less than
    ten permanent staff)
  - You will find below some information including our statutes, the rules of procedure
    and the annual moral reports.
