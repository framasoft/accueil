  ## Presentation of @:txt.soft

  From the educational world and now turned towards popular education, @:html.soft
  is above all a network of projects, of which the first, [directory
  @:link.libre](@:link.libre), dates back to 2001.

  These projects are run by people working together with the same desire: promote
  digital freedoms.

  Respect for the fundamental freedoms of users, guaranteed by legal contracts
  (the [free licenses](@:link.wFreeLicense)), is at the heart of the
  librist movement and ensures that the human remains in control of the digital
  tool.

  The @:html.soft’s goal is to offer, mainly online, a set of concrete and
  practical tools to facilitate adoption:

  - of free software (directory, USB sticks, installer…);
  - of free cultural creations (blog, translation, publishing house…);
  - of free services (more than 30 free services in the project @:html.dio).

  Presented as a "gateway to the Free World", the network @:html.soft wants
  to position itself as a bridge between the librarian community and the general
  public.

  ## The @:txt.soft association

  The network @:html.soft relies on its large community of volunteers but
  could not exist if it wasn’t supported by an association founded in 2004.

  The @:html.soft association is a 1901 non-profit association whose character
  of general interest authorizes a tax deduction. Which shows its willingness
  to stay an association on a human scale (less than forty members, less than
  ten permanent staff)

  You will find below some information including our statutes, the rules of procedure
  and the annual moral reports.
