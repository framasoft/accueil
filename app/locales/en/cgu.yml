    text: '<b>But</b> that doesn’t mean you should think we’re kittens:'
    list:
    - 'Clause <em>"The law is the law, and we don’t want to end up in jail"</em>:
      you must respect the law (whether it is well made or silly), otherwise your
      account will be deleted;'
    - 'Clause <em>"Thank you for being polite and respectful with your neighbours
      on duty"</em>: you must respect other users by being civic-minded and politeness,
      if not your content, even your account, can be deleted, without negotiation;'
    - 'Clause <em>"If it breaks, we are not obliged to repair"</em>: @:color.soft
      offers this service for free. If you lose data, through your fault or ours,
      sorry, but it happens. We’ll do what we can to get it back, but we assign
      no obligation of result. Clearly, avoid putting sensitive or important data
      on services @:color.soft, because in case of loss, we do not guarantee
      their recovery;'
    - 'Clause <em>"If you are not happy, you are invited to go elsewhere"</em>:
      if the service does not suit you, you are free to find some an equivalent
      (or better) elsewhere, or to install your own;'
    - 'Clause <em>"Any abuse will be punished"</em>: if a user abuses the service,
      for example by monopolizing shared machine resources, or by publishing content
      considered to be irrelevant, its content or his/her account can be deleted
      without warning or negotiation. @:color.soft remains the sole judge of
      this notion of "abuse" in order to provide the best possible service to all
      its users. If it seems anti-democratic, anti-libristic, anti-free speech to
      you, please refer to the previous clause;'
    - 'Clause <em>"Nothing is eternal"</em>: services can close (for example, because
      of a lack of funds to maintain them), they can be victims of intrusion (the
      "100% secure" does not exist). We encourage you to keep a copy of the data
      that is important to you, because @:color.soft can not be held responsible
      for their hosting without time limit.'
