  title: 6 good reasons to support us
  list:

  - 3. Because we are the good guys!
  - 4. To choose how you taxes are used
  - 5. Because the gift economy make us independent
  - 6. To change the world altogether
  desc:
  - NSA, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple… E. Snowden revelations have
    shown that the worst nightmares of computer scientists are alive. We are confined
    into services, tools and a culture centralising our data and using them with
    no limits. The only way out goes through using and educating to free softwares
    and services, respectful of OUR fundamental rights.
  - For 16 years, @:txt.soft has been a french-speaking doorway to free software
    and culture. A link between developers of open solutions and the general public.
    The success of alternative services from "@:txt.dio" shows that it’s possible
    to respect people and their data. We want to go further and only your support
    will will allow us to propose or refine more services.
  - '@:txt.soft is a group of retired people, employees, unemployed, artists,
    teachers and students… Not really spealized in computer science, but well enough
    informed to know that Free software is a part of the solution. So we commit
    ourselves to some ethics through a <a href="@:link.soft/en/charte">charter</a>
    and we spent our time highlighting or introducing more and more free solutions
    to a wider audience.'
  - To manage properly the projects, @:txt.soft is based upon a non-profit
    (1901 law in France), recognized of general interest. Your donations can be
    deduced from your taxes (in France only). For instance, with a recurring donation
    of €120 (€10 per month for one year), the reduction is €79.20 and so the actual
    expense is €40.80. Doing so, you participate directly to our projects, productions,
    structural expenses and the salary of several employees.
  - As soon as you click, share, use a software or a website/service, you give it
    some value. This is attention economy. This attention is then financiarized
    with advertising and the sale of data (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft,
    etc.) or with enclosing type of sales (Apple, Amazon). This attention can also
    create some value absed upon donation, sharing and participation (Wikipedia).
    We have chosen this last model for us. This gives us independency from the market
    laws and total freedom to our donators.
  - 'Yes, no less. One project after another, we demonstrate that free, simple,
    respectful and community-driven alternatives are possible. In our <a href="https://framabook.org">collaborative
    publishing house</a>, our writers let you get freely their digital ebooks and
    get paid through paper sales or your direct donations. Our <a href="@:link.dio/en/list">De-google-ify
    services</a> are more and more used… There is still a long road to do and we
    can go on thanks to your support: "There is a long way to go, but the road is
    Free".'
